<p>Data Science Yes!!! but Statistics No??</p>
<p>Data Science is a hot topic trending everywhere. People become curious about how Artificial Intelligence(AI),  machine learning, and computer vision work. Building applications on these technologies seems fascinating, and in many cases, people start stepping into it without knowing the depth involved. No, I am not infiltrating fear, but yes, it is no cakewalk. Marine scientists still keep discovering new findings, and so is the depth of data science. I want to highlight certain things which I feel beginners need to understand. There are four main components on a superficial level. They are collecting data, analyzing the data, modeling, and predicting. Amateur individuals pick structured data such as in the form of excel and text and proceed further. It is not the conventional case always. Data can be very unstructured, messy, and inconsistent. The analysis includes exploratory data analysis, data patterns, insights, and visual graphical representation. Based on this output, data modeling comes into the picture. Python has many large machine learning libraries such as sci-kit learn, scipy, tensor flow, etc. Internally all these model libraries are built on &ldquo;stats.&rdquo; For example, logistic regression uses a sigmoid function to calculate the values. It takes us to the basics of statistics involving exponential components; the concept behind linear regression takes us back to the school where we solved an equation of a line. If we have libraries to do and the data science pipeline is being automated, why do we need data scientists?
A data scientist should decide the selection of a machine learning algorithm. Selection is based on observing the Exploratory data analysis(EDA), tuning the hyperparameters to increase accuracy, optimizing the loss function, data transformation, and derivation of new attributes. Sound domain knowledge is an essential application for a data scientist or an analyst. It requires a strong foundation in statistics. Many job applicants observe a Ph.D. qualification as a requirement for a data scientist or at least hands-on experience in the field. It may be why few find it tough to get a data scientist job as a complete fresher. Data Science is continuously expanding. Amazon&rsquo;s Alexa and Apple&rsquo;s Siri are well-known voice assistants utilizing natural language processing technology, yet I feel it requires improvement. According to &ldquo;Hardware Business Review,&rdquo; Data Scientist is the sexiest job of the 21st century. Many phrases such as analyst, business analyst, and data analyst are used interchangeably in the market; in the end, it is based on the fundamentals of data. Raw potatoes are awful when we eat, but it becomes yummy when fried and added with spices.
Similarly, a data scientist must tell a story out of dirty data through their skillset by applying statistical techniques to make a better decision. Data is the oil that drives the ship. AI  will conquer the future.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Machines&rdquo; are biased too, not just humans.</p>
<p>Many believe that Artificial Intelligence(AI) will be the future without exercising any significant flaws. Watching the &ldquo;Coded Bias&rdquo; documentary on Netflix changed my whole perspective. Creators have embedded their unconscious bias into the technology. For example, facial recognition AI developed by IBM, Facebook and Google performed better on lighter skin males than females; yes, you heard that right. There was digital discrimination based on gender and race. Many non-programmers are also aware of what algorithms are, algorithms are very influential, and at the same time, they can also be very destructive. AI has been unregulated for a long time. Digital discrimination among credit card holders, Amazon&rsquo;s resume bias on gender were the recent instances that stood out as hot news in the market. As per National AI policies and strategies, since 2017, at least 60 countries have adopted some form of artificial intelligence policy. The truth is that machines are replicating as the world exists. Increasing inequality in the world of the internet is becoming normalized. The necessity to build inclusive data-centric software is growing in demand. But going against the norms of the tech giants or challenging their outcomes may result in a lack of support or the backing needed.
For example, people&rsquo;s minds get influenced by the posts and pages they like on social media. Algorithms are designed to connect more with similarities across the world. In social media, there might exist many fake posts, news. As the source of information is not authentic, this leads to propaganda. Riots occurred in many cases because of a single post or a tweet.
Positively: Many people have made the best out of it. They discovered new content, connected to great individuals, established a network, and shared knowledge. People have built their careers through social media.
In a Negative way: Hate speeches, hate comments, fake posts, morphed videos are in large numbers. Such patterns are driving the netizens to think irrationally. We know that negativity spreads faster than positivity. If not appropriately regulated, this might have a profound impact in the future.
Intelligence is not about just winning a chess game. Intelligence is not just the raw form of mathematics, but it has some ethics. Assume a software has to predict the victory or loss in the big federal political election contest. Here a short span loss might have the hidden potential to win a big battle in the future. If AI thinks winning is only the key performance metric, it might not give a long sight approach. The software must include an emotional quotient that segregates the biases and points them as outliers.
If tech giants think this bias in the code may not harm them economically, they are wrong. In my opinion, trust is what people are bound to for any product. A recent update in WhatsApp&rsquo;s privacy policies caused people to download &ldquo;telegram.&rdquo; Many such policies might harm themselves in the long run. The world has an adequate number of talents, and alternatives always exist. Skilled people may not get hired in the case of resume filtering; credit card holders might face the same. Many realize that social media is used to polarize votes during elections. Influential people want to take control of the masses through AI technologies. Companies see in terms of earning revenue rather than what is best for humans. This greed for dominance can be very harmful to humans as well.
Thrive for &ldquo;Algorithmic Justice&rdquo; becomes a factor where it would be difficult to solve the problem shortly if left entirely unregulated. Many countries plan to have their software and social media rather than a single globalized one. These can lead to a significant loss to the tech giant, thereby erasing monopoly leading to revenue loss and loss of the brand in the long term. &ldquo;Accuracy Draws attention, but we cannot ignore the abuse.&rdquo;</p>
